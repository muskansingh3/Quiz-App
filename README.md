Quiz App

This is my simple **Quiz App** made using **HTML, CSS, and JS**.  
You can answer multiple-choice questions and submit them to see your results.  
I made it to practice JS logic, DOM manipulation, and working with forms.

 Files
- `index.html` → The main quiz page
- `style.css` → The styling for the quiz
- `script.js` → JS logic for questions and answers
